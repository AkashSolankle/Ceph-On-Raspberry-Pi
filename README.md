# Ceph-On-Raspberry-Pi
A Ceph cluster on Raspberry Pi is an awesome way to create a RADOS home storage solution (NAS) that is highly redundant and low power usage. Itâ€™s also a low cost way to get into Ceph, which may or may not be the future of storage (software defined storage definitely is as a whole). Ceph on ARM is an interesting idea in and of itself.
